# Human Activity Recognition Project

This project aims to recognize human activities using data collected from smartphones. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and training machine learning models for activity recognition.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Download the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) and place them in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run `main.py` to load the data, preprocess it, visualize the features, and train machine learning models.
2. Follow the prompts to input values for features and see the predicted activity.

## Contents

- `main.py`: Contains the main script to run the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the required Python packages and their versions.
- `train.csv` and `test.csv`: Dataset files containing training and testing data.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
